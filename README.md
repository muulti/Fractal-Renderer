# Fractal Renderer

A **Unity project** for rendering mesmerizing fractals, I programmed a setup for the **Mandelbrot Set** and **Julia Set** (and maybe i´ll work on building a fractal of my own).

## Renderer
- It´s a compute shader, so it may get tough on the GPU especially if the max number of iterations per pixel is tinkered with.
